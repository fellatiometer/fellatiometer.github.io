<p style="margin: 0;">upon the realization that youtube embeds are coming home with the cows, i've decided to begin the weekly music thread today, rather than whenever they add them, so here's our very first song;</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDvvt1kmL1Q" style="margin: 0;"><h2 style="margin: 0;">Rock My Emotions by Kitsune<sup>2</sup></h2>

<p>first off, about the artsit, Kitsune<sup>2</sup> is not real, it's a pseudonym of one <a href="https://heckscaper.com/">Emma Essex</a>. Kitsune<sup>2</sup> was developed as a pseudonym to make music for the game series <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=mungyodance">Mungyodance</a>, a game developed by VULPvibe Entertainment, a branch of Emma's own record label, <a href="https://heckscaper.com/backcat/cata.html">VULPvibe Records</a>. the game is basically stepmania, but with music presumably chosen by Emma. Kitsune<sup>2</sup> would later be used as a pseudonym on various VULPvibe Records releases, including today's album of note, <a href="https://lapfoxarchive.com/albums/Squaredance">Squaredance</a>!</p>

<p>Squaredance was released in 2008, with THIS album cover by Havoc.

thats right, i lied! dont believe everything you read on the internet, especially if i'm the one who wrote it! >:D
the album cover on the abandoned '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RenardQueenston">LAPFOX TRAX</a>' youtube channel is from the 2009 re-release, with a new album cover by <a href="https://suguroart.tumblr.com/">Suguro</a>. honestly, i dont know which one i prefer. the newer one is a bit more chibi, for lack of a better term, but the older one is a lot more ratty, and i prefer the font, but i prefer the background in the new one, too. good thing i dont have to choose.</p>

<p>the album contains some pretty good music, with a whopping 31 tracks and a 71 minute runtime, this album is bound to have some bangers, and it does. my personal favorites are Avast Your Ass, Rock My Emotions (obviously), Helix - U R Everything (K2 Bootleg Remix), Rainbow Tylenol, and Giant Enemy Crab.</p>

<p>also, the re-release had a pretty awesome cd print! i would like to own this some day.

they abuse that character art a bit too much though, dont they?</p>

<p>but enough about the album, the reason i chose this song today was so i could talk a little bit about my personal connection to this song, and why i like it so much. i first discovered Kitsune<sup>2</sup> in the ye old year of 2011. back when tf2 was alive and goldfinger could sell, i was just beginning my internet journey. almost 2 years beforehand, a little show called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQa2-DY7Y_Q&list=PL24C8378F296DB656">BFDI</a> was just beginning. created by the Huang brothers of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jacknjellify">Jacknjellify</a>, BFDI would go on to create its own genre of Total Drama Island ripoffs called 'Object Shows', with copycats such as '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogePPeaVt0U&list=PL9C8C6384782133C6">Inanimate Insanity</a>' and other, less memorable shows, but in 2011, they were just celebrating their 1000 subscriber special, and celebrating with a series of ytpmv's.</p>

<p>for those of you uninlighened folk, ytpmv stands for YouTube Poop Music Video, a YouTube Poop that creates a song, and Jacknjellify had chosen some iconic ytpmv songs to produce, starting with '<a href="https://youtu.be/lEd8zAL_ggc">Intensive Care Unit</a>', another song by Emma Essex, under the pseudonym of Renard, the titular '<a href="https://youtu.be/s336v7Ege_w">Rock My Emotions</a>', then, after tribute video delays, '<a href="https://youtu.be/U7cvSpA6578">Am I Waiting On A Squarespace</a>' by Rev, MAKI, and R.Cena, and finally, '<a href="https://youtu.be/5A7UaGcEc28">Rainbow Tylenol</a>'. these were all uploaded right around when i was getting into youtube, so i got a front row seat to what i only learned years later was the ytpmv scene. also, this was my first exposure to furries<sup>[citation needed]</sup>, and this style of electronic music as a whole.</p>

<p>these videos, along with the release of Portal 2 in 2012, and BedBananas intro songs, are the reasons i love the music i love nowadays, all of this media, which i grew to love, deeply influenced my musical tastes. i'll carry their impact on me forever, and i wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
